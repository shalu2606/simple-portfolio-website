Portfolio Website
This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website, a project crafted to represent my skills, experiences, and creative work. Built entirely with HTML and CSS, this two-page site is both sleek and fully responsive, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across devices.

Page Breakdown:
Home: A welcoming introduction to who I am, showcasing my key skills, professional summary, and a quick glimpse into what drives me.
Projects: A dedicated space where I present selected works, each project is accompanied by a detailed description, the challenges faced, the solutions implemented, and links to live demos or source code.
This portfolio is a reflection of my dedication to front-end development and design aesthetics. It’s not just about showcasing projects; it’s about telling my story through a well-crafted digital experience.
